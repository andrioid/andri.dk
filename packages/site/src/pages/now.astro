    <Section title="Reading again!">
      <p>
        Currently churning through The Dresden Files series (book 8 atm). I love
        these books. They mix together fantasy, old school investigative stories
        and a the Bruce Willis of wizards. Always in the wrong place at the
        wrong time.

    <Section title="Programming, for fun">
      <p>
        I have a few pet-projects that I'm working on. Mostly for learning
        purposes, but it would sure be fun to spawn a business at some point.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        I'm reading and experimenting with event-sourcing, cqrs and
        domain-driven-design on the backend and on the frontend I'm playing with
        Tailwind CSS.

    <Section title="My son keeps growing">
      <p>
        Our little half-Icelandic, half-Dane, all Viking son keeps us
        entertained and challanged at home. He's soon to be 7 years old and his
        little head is filled with questions that I hope Wikipedia can help
        answer. We've started doing physics experiments together.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        He's already very interested in computers of all sizes, but I dare not
        push it on him. He'll get there if and when he wants to.

    <Section title="Engaged, but not in a hurry">
      <p>
        Me and my girlfriend got engaged. I proposed during a hide-and-seek game
        with our son. I was going for: "rememberable, but silly". I think I
        nailed it. No date set yet.
