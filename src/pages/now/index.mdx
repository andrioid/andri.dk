# What's up?

Let's say I know you, and we'd meet in the street and you'd ask me what's up? A [now-page](https://now.page/) is what you'd say; instead of "fine".

- I'm working at Apacta A/S as a Lead Frontend Developer
- I got married 2 years ago (2022) to Louise and we live near Aalborg, Denmark with our son.

### Reading

- **Spellmonger series**: An interesting take on magic, our universe and beyond.

### Watching

- **Bing Bang Theory**: Watching it with my wife. We started years ago, but recently started up again.
- **Vox Machina**: Adult fantasy similar to the D&D universe with great character development and fresh takes on every situation.

### Learning

- Keeping up with frontend tech these days is almost a full-time job
- Exploring alternatives of single-page-applications; such as HTMX, Turbo and other server-side ways of rendering web content.
- Playing around with Home Assistant at home; lot's of fun stuff. Might pick up Python.

### Hobbies

- Playing Overwatch with my son in the evening. He's quickly catching up to my skill-level.
- In 2020 I got my first pizza oven, and I've been making pizza at home since. I have a big oven (50cm wide), so I can make 18" inch pies at home, from scratch.
- Recently my son has shown interest in cooking, so he helps out a lot in the kitchen.
