# Now

Let's say I know you, and we'd meet in the street and you'd ask me how I am? A [now-page](https://now.page/) is what you'd say; instead of "fine"..

- I'm working at [Apacta A/S](https://www.apacta.com) as a Lead Frontend Developer
- I got married some years ago (2022) to Louise and we live near Aalborg, Denmark with our son.

### Reading

#### Currently

- **[Battle Mage series](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34532979-battle-mage)**: Magic, dragons and a rising hero.

#### Recommending

- **Mistborn series**: Just finished the first all the books, and hungry for more!

### Watching

- **Silo**: Reminds me of Fallout; but more focus on people, the isolation and drama in the silo. Well executed!
- **Vox Machina**: Adult fantasy similar to the D&D universe with great character development and fresh takes on every situation.
- **Meighty Nein**: Adult fantasy from the makers of Vox Machina with longer episodes and more ambitious story.

### Learning

- Keeping up with frontend tech these days is almost a full-time job
- Exploring alternatives of single-page-applications; such as HTMX, Turbo and other server-side ways of rendering web content.
- Playing around with Home Assistant at home; lot's of fun stuff. Might pick up Python.
- Learning Godot for game development. Nothing too serious.

### Work

- We're almost done migrating the older parts of our customer facing pages. That will allow us to clean up a bunch of legacy
- I've been in DevOps mode these past 6 months migrating our infrastructure to Kubernetes from an older Swarm/Nomad setup

### Pet projects

- [EventPuffin](https://www.eventpuffin.com) is my take on prying event-management (Birthdays, team-building, meetups, etc) from Facebook into a more inclusive platform where your grandma who doesn't use that Internet thingy can still click on your sms to RSVP.
- [Hygge.chat](https://hygge.chat) is if you'd create a weird mutant baby between Slack and IRC. I was getting frustrated with Slack's UX and wanted to see if Ergo (IRCv3 over websockets) was a viable backend.

### Hobbies

- Playing Overwatch with my son in the evening. He's quickly catching up to my skill-level.
- In 2020 I got my first pizza oven, and I've been making pizza at home since. I have a big oven (50cm wide), so I can make 18" inch pies at home, from scratch.
- My son loves cooking, so he helps out a lot in the kitchen.
