# Now

Let's say I know you, and we'd meet in the street and you'd ask me how I am? A [now-page](https://now.page/) is what you'd say; instead of "fine".

- I'm working at [Apacta A/S](https://www.apacta.com) as a Lead Frontend Developer
- I got married some years ago (2022) to Louise and we live near Aalborg, Denmark with our son.

### Reading

- **[Dungeon Heart series](https://www.amazon.com/Dungeon-Heart-5-book-series/dp/B08P836VC2)**: A rpg-inspired fantasy, from the viewpoint of the dungeon. Weird, but fun.
- **Spellmonger series**: An interesting take on magic, our universe and beyond.
- **Mistborg series**: Just finished the first 3 books, and hungry for more!

### Watching

- **Silo**: Reminds me of Fallout; but more focus on people, the isolation and drama in the silo. Well executed!
- **Vox Machina**: Adult fantasy similar to the D&D universe with great character development and fresh takes on every situation.

### Learning

- Keeping up with frontend tech these days is almost a full-time job
- Exploring alternatives of single-page-applications; such as HTMX, Turbo and other server-side ways of rendering web content.
- Playing around with Home Assistant at home; lot's of fun stuff. Might pick up Python.
- Learning Godot for game development. Nothing too serious.

### Pet projects

- [EventPuffin](https://www.eventpuffin.com) is my take on prying event-management (Birthdays, team-building, meetups, etc) from Facebook into a more inclusive platform where your grandma who doesn't use that Internet thingy can still click on your sms to RSVP.
- [Technical Scrolls](https://technical.scrolls.org) is a tech feed generator for the open social network Bluesky.

### Hobbies

- Playing Overwatch with my son in the evening. He's quickly catching up to my skill-level.
- In 2020 I got my first pizza oven, and I've been making pizza at home since. I have a big oven (50cm wide), so I can make 18" inch pies at home, from scratch.
- Recently my son has shown interest in cooking, so he helps out a lot in the kitchen.
