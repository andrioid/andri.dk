# What's up?

Let's say I know you, and we'd meet in the street and you'd ask me what's up? A [now-page](https://now.page/) is what you'd say; instead of "fine".

- I'm working at Apacta A/S as a Lead Frontend Developer
- I got married 2 years ago (2022) to Louise and we live near Aalborg, Denmark with our son.
- Reading

  - **Spellmonger series**: An interesting take on magic, our universe and beyond.

- Watching

  - **Bing Bang Theory**: Watching it with my wife. We started years ago, but recently started up again.

- Learning
  - Keeping up with frontend tech these days is almost a full-time job
  - Exploring alternatives of single-page-applications; such as HTMX, Turbo and other server-side ways of rendering web content.
  - Playing around with Home Assistant at home; lot's of fun stuff. Might pick up Python.

**What's up with you?**
