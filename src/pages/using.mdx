# Using

Here is a list of tools that I use. If I need to reinstall a computer, this serves as a nice document. If it helps you too, that's a bonus!

## Hardware

- **Personal laptop**: <Icon name="mac" /> Apple Macbook Air M3
- **Work laptop**: <Icon name="mac" /> Apple Macbook Pro M1 Max w. 32G RAM.
- **Gaming PC**: <Icon name="linux" /> AMD Ryzen 3500 w. AMD RX 7900XT GPU, 32G RAM, 2TB SSD
- **Mouse**: Razer Basilisk V3
- **Keyboard**: Ducky One 2 TKL RGB
- **Monitor**: [Samsung 34" CF791](https://www.samsung.com/us/computing/monitors/gaming/34--cf791-wqhd-monitor-lc34f791wqnxza/) for home-office/gaming
- **Office Chair**: [Herman Miller Aeron](https://www.hermanmiller.com/products/seating/office-chairs/aeron-chair/). It's comfortable during work, play or just relaxing
- **Office Chair**: [HÃ…G Capisco 8106](https://www.officechairsusa.com/hag-capisco-8106-15-day-standard-ship/) is great for work; but not for relaxing. It's rigid and forces you sit "correctly". It's great!

## Software

### Utilities

- [Rectangle Pro](https://rectangleapp.com/pro): <Icon name="mac" /> Great for managing windows, tiling and different displays.

### This website

- [Astro](https://astro.build): Web framework that works with multiple view libraries. Runs this site.
- [Fly.io](https://fly.io): Hosting provider. Easy to use if you know Dockerfile, and nice free tier.
