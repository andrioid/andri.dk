![](/sites/andrioid.net/files/lanification-front.png)**Semester:** Fall of 2009 **Authors:** Anders Tornvig, Andreas Møgelsmose, Andri Óskarsson The idea was to create a software framework for peer-to-peer based office communication. Tasks such as short-term event planning and a common notification platform have no unified solution so the aim was to create one. It was programmed using Qt 4.5 and C++ and contained over 4000 lines of code. We made use of XML, TCP, UDP, XML querying and SQLite databases. Two protocols were created for this project; one for message transport (LMTP) and one for peer discovery (LPDP). Further information can be found in the attached report (English).
