**Semester:** Spring of 2008 **Authors:** Anders Tornvig, Andreas Møgelsmose, Andri Óskarsson, Christoffer Hjortlund, René Therkelsen Our second semester, the project idea was to create a sniper detection system capable of locating from which direction shots were coming from by using multiple networked computers to listen for the shots and triangulate the source from the difference in time. Project made use of microphones, GPS dongles, Avahi (for dynamic connections). Second implementation made use of threading as well. Note: The report attached is written in Danish (and I can't really take credit for any of the writing)
