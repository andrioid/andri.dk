title: Live reloading a Go web application

import video from "./live-reloading-golang.mp4";

I was playing around with server-rendering, and couldn't really find a good workflow for restarting the Go server, generate templates and generate CSS on changes without manually reloading it.

<video controls>
  <source src={video} />
</video>

It's not quite as instant as hot-module-reloading in JS, but it's better than managing it yourself.

### NPM dependencies

We're not really using NPM for anything except developer tooling, but you need it all the same.

```shell
npm init
npm install -D browser-sync concurrently nodemon tailwindcss
```

### Go dependencies

If you're using [Templ](https://templ.guide), then run...

```shell
go install github.com/a-h/templ/cmd/templ@latest
```

### package.json

Then change the scripts portion of your `package.json` look like this.

```json
{
  "name": "web",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "Note: Strictly used for dev tools. Not production",
  "main": "index.js",
  "private": true,
  "scripts": {
    "watch:go": "nodemon -e go,sql --exec 'go build . && ./app' --signal SIGTERM",
    "watch:css": "tailwindcss -i ./web/global.css -o ./web/public/generated.css --watch",
    "watch:templ": "templ generate --watch",
    "watch:browser": "browser-sync start --port 3001 --no-ui --proxy 'localhost:3000' --files ./app",
    "dev": "concurrently npm:watch:* --kill-others",
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC",
  "devDependencies": {
    "browser-sync": "^2.29.3",
    "concurrently": "^8.2.2",
    "nodemon": "^3.0.2",
    "tailwindcss": "^3.3.6"
  }
}
```

### Run it

```shell
npm run dev
```

### Honorable mention

I tried using [Air](https://github.com/cosmtrek/air), but ended up dropping it for Nodemon. I already needed NPM for Tailwind (plugins), and it works great.
