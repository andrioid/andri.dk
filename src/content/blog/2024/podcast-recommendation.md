Some of the podcasts I enjoy during my bike-trip to work.

### [Soft Skills Engineering](https://softskills.audio/)

Soft Skills are an underrated ability in engineers and Dave and Jamison deliver their advise in such a funny and helpful way that it's hard not to smile while listening to it.

### [Syntax.fm](https://syntax.fm/)

Scott and Wes are really in touch with what's trending in the tech world and usually have both great guests and interesting takes on a various range of subjects.

### [Go time](https://changelog.com/gotime)

A great Go(lang) specific show with deep technical topics and plenty of humor.

### [The Changelog](https://changelog.com/podcast)

Good all-around tech podcast.

### [.NET Rocks](https://www.dotnetrocks.com/about)

Even though I don't really program in .NET, I enjoy this show very much. Patterns and ways of working are universal and the hosts are very entertaining.

### [Darknet Diaries](https://darknetdiaries.com/)

Host interviews hackers and other cyber-criminals about their exploits and mistakes.

### [devtools.fm](https://www.devtools.fm/)

Recently started listening, but so far very happy with their content which focuses on developer tooling (duh).

### [Home Assistant Podcast](https://hasspodcast.io/)

As someone who likes tinkering with smart-home stuff, this show is very inspiring to what you can do with a few lines of Python or YAML.

### [JS Party](https://changelog.com/jsparty)

In depth show about all things JavaScript/TypeScript.

### [React Native Radio](https://reactnativeradio.com/)

A show from Infinite Red about React Native, Expo and the art of making cross platform apps.

### [Self Hosted](https://selfhosted.show/)

An inspiring show about software that you can host yourself without "the cloud". I may not do a lot of self hosting, but I enjoy listening to others talk about it in detail.

### [Shop Talk](https://shoptalkshow.com/)

Somewhat Ruby specific, but a great all-around tech pod cast.
