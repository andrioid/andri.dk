        <p>
          Currently churning through The Dresden Files series (book 8 atm). I
          love these books. They mix together fantasy, old school investigative
          stories and a the Bruce Willis of wizards. Always in the wrong place
          at the wrong time.

      <Section title="Programming, for fun">
        <p>
          I have a few pet-projects that I'm working on. Mostly for learning
          purposes, but it would sure be fun to spawn a business at some point.

          I'm reading and experimenting with event-sourcing, cqrs and
          domain-driven-design on the backend and on the frontend I'm playing
          with Tailwind CSS.

        <p>
          Our little half-Icelandic, half-Dane, all Viking son keeps us
          entertained and challanged at home. He's soon to be 5 years old and
          his little head is filled with questions that I hope Wikipedia can
          help answer.

          He's already very interested in computers of all sizes, but I dare not
          push it on him. He'll get there if and when he wants to.

      <Section title="Engaged, but not in a hurry">
        <p>
          Me and my girlfriend got engaged last October. I proposed during a
          hide-and-seek game with our son. I was going for: "rememberable, but
          silly". I think I nailed it. No date set yet.

      <Section title="Recently switched jobs">
        <p>
          I was forced to quit a job that I loved last April. The could smell
          the burnout coming and had to bail out.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          I took a job in May at an Aarhus based company (1 hour drive).
          Fortunately, they were kind enough to allow me to work from here 4
          days a week. It's still quite new, so we'll see how it works out.
