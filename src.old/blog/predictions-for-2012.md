Please don't call me cheesy, but I am going to attempt to do some predictions for the year 2012 - like so many others.

*   2012 will not be the year of the Linux desktop. We're already there, but nobody noticed.
*   The patent war will escalate even further and continue to halt innovation.
*   Apple will release its first device without Steve Jobs. It will receive mixed reviews.
*   Google+ becomes the new Facebook - except the old Facebook will still be there.
*   [Buddycloud](http://buddycloud.com) will see its first public release and pave a way for distributed social networks
*   Google will reveal that Google+ is in fact a federated social network through XMPP
*   Twitter will be shaken with a privacy scandal that forces its users to reconsider.
*   Windows Phone 7 will continue to lack adoption, compared to Android and iPhone
*   Steve Ballmer will be fired.
*   Stephen Elop will be fired. (maybe just wishful thinking)
*   Energy Storage breakthrough will see the light of day.

That's all I can think of - I will review this next year and we can see if anything held up..
