As you can see from my frontpage, I haven't blogged since 2014. Sorry about that.

I'm learning new things while building this site, again again. It's currently running on Gatsby with Tailwind-CSS, GraphQL and a few plugins.

I'm also playing around with react-pdf and JSON-Resume. My CV is currently generated with the site and I plan to make the site, and the CV fetch data from my resume.json.

More on that later.
