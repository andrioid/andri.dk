I started hacking around with PHP in 1998 but never really considered it development until I learned what I used to consider "superior languages". A decade later, PHP is going strong and I am actually employed at a company where we do a lot of PHP (my opinions are my own). I've been wanting to implement something smart for deploying PHP projects (like continuous-integration) and decided to compile a list of useful links here. Wouldn't really consider this an article, just a placeholder of links.
