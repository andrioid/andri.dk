Between 1997 and 2005 I spent a lot of time on IRC (Internet Relay Chat) as Merlin@IRCnet. During that time I ended up managing a few channels with a bunch of young people in them. What started to annoy me were certain patterns of people that joined, just to annoy other people. So I decided to create a system to automatically punish those people, but also a system that wouldn't punish actual conversations. It makes heavy use of regular expressions and is written in TCL. Recently I came across a version of my script online, so I decided to post it here for safe-keeping. An unfinished next-gen. version called justice.tcl is also [available](http://andrioid.net/sites/andrioid.net/files/justice.tcl).
