**This project is discontinued. The latest version went down with the two hard disks that failed :(** For the last couple of weeks I've been playing around with HTML5 or more specifically, the canvas element. Coupled with jQuery and some basic Javascript I've created a 2 dimensional game map for a strategy board game (like [Travian](https://www.travian.com)). Should work in most 2D browser game worlds as long as the coordinates are two dimensional.
