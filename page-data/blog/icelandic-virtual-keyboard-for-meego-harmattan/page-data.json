So, when I got my awesome Nokia N9, I wasn't all that surprised that there was no text input option for \"Íslenska\" or Icelandic. Fortunately, The Nokia N9 is mostly open source and the on screen keyboard uses <a href=\"https://wiki.maliit.org/\">Maliit</a>. For those who like custom keyboards, they can check out <a href=\"http://mesinput.com\">MesInput</a>. I have created a virtual keyboard file for Icelandic and contributed it to the MesInput project (awaiting confirmation). Until then, you can download the file from <a href=\"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/25593/andrioid.net/is.xml\">here</a>: Then place it into: <code class=\"language-text\">/home/user/.config/meego-keyboard/layouts</code> The file can be uploaded through the SDK (sftp/ssh) or through USB mass storage (untested). Edit: Óli mentioned that Hátækni made a similar VKB file. It can be downloaded as a .deb file from <a href=\"http://www.hataekni.is/gogn/gogn/is_keyboard_0.2.deb\">their site</a>. I've looked through the file and the main difference is that they do not provide all of the accented characters, common to Nordic languages. In any case, it's all good.</p>","excerpt":"Coming from a nation of 300.000 people has its downsides, like lack of keyboard support on various platforms.
