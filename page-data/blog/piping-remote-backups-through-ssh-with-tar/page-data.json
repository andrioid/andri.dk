If you need this to be automatic, you can use password-less public key authentication instead (although I will not cover it here). If you risk that your session might die before finishing the copy, try something like 'screen' before running the command. This shouldn't be much of a revelation to most linux geeks, but useful non the less and written here for documentation purposes.</p>","excerpt":"As a part of my site restoration, this page was salvaged and may not be up to date While usually operating some sort of backup systems, it may become necessary to perform at remote backup of a machine without initiating locally.
